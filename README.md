### Core Mission
Cherenkov-AI is the first open-source tool developed under the Ulysses Protocol. Its mission is to provide a robust, extensible, and user-friendly library for analyzing high-energy physics data with state-of-the-art AI. We aim to accelerate the search for new physics by creating reproducible, powerful tools for the entire research community.

### Key Features (Planned)
*   **Efficient Data Handling:** A streamlined interface for loading and processing public datasets from CERN, Fermilab, and other institutions.
*   **Model Zoo:** A collection of pre-trained and easily configurable models for common HEP tasks, including:
    *   Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) for event classification.
    *   Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) for system modeling.
*   **Advanced Visualization:** Tools for rendering and exploring complex particle event topologies in 3D.

### Installation
```bash
# Installation instructions will be available in a future release.
pip install cherenkov-ai
```

### Quick Start
```python
# A minimal working example will be provided here.
import cherenkov as ck

# Load data
events = ck.load_dataset('LHCb-OpenData-2017')

# Analyze
model = ck.models.GNNClassifier()
results = model.predict(events)
```

### Project Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1 (Q3 2025):** Core engine for data ingestion and baseline model implementation.
2.  **Phase 2 (Q4 2025):** Expansion of model zoo and addition of visualization tools.
3.  **Phase 3 (2026):** Integration with QWB education portal and first research publication.
